                "My favorite part of Bebe’s Bungalow adventures is when Uncle Bud took my children, (Marty, Johnny, and then later Julie) to Trout Lake for a camping/fishing trip. Other friends of Uncle Bud’s joined in on the exciting trip to Trout Lake. Here is a photo of the many times everyone sat around the kitchen table of Bebe’s Bungalow to celebrate the happy memories of the trip to Trout Lake. Uncle Bud and his friends used to kid Johnny that they were going to use him as bear bait."

                "Somebody asked some question about some esoteric concept that I happened to know the answer. I offered the answer, and a short explanation on something completely trivial and useless. After my soliloquy, Bebe comments in a low, deeper voice, 'Oooh, you’re smaaaart.' She said it sincerely, but with just enough emphasis that made me think, maybe I wasn’t so smart. Makes me smile just thinking about it."

I remember Amelia sneaking a look to me with those questioning eyes... 'Mom?' It all worked out and we enjoyed laughing at ourselves on the way home."

Watching our kids play together, taking them tubing and wakeboarding, taking a boat ride along the lake and having a snack tray packed for the cruise. Stopping for the kids to jump off the rock. Cruising over in the boat to enjoy the bamboozler pizza, of course that was must each time we were there. Enjoying the campfire at night and then coming in and catching a movie or some show episode from a tape. And of course we have the blessing of you taking us in the Boundary Waters area to fish, camp, canoe and enjoy nature no other way. You know that was never my highlight ;) but I most certainly enjoyed getting the opportunity of doing it the 5 star way! And of course the memories my boys have from it, they will cherish and talk about forever made it all worth it!! Farley Family, thanks so much for including and blessing us with your wonderful hospitality and love!"

                "The Cabin was our 'happy place!' When up at the cabin you were able to forget all worries in your life and just focus on relaxing and having fun. When our mom died, Katie, Mark and I decided that instead of canceling our trip to the cabin it was actually the best place for us to go. The cabin and Farley family allowed us to put aside our grief for a few days and just relax and enjoy life. I think that speaks mountains for the 'magic of the cabin.' I loved that two of my kids learned to drive a jet ski up there. I loved all of our bags games where we always made silly rules. One of our best rules was that you had to hold something in your hand at all times while playing&mdash;this was actually a way for us to not have to put our drinks down while playing. When David played with us, Cathy told him that he would have to hold the bottle of ketchup in his hand while playing. He objected to this stupid rule but he played anyway. David was very tolerant of Katie and I; it takes a special man to put up with us. This picture is when we took a boat ride and put one foot in Canada and one in the US&mdash;the kids still talk about that. Hope to be up there again soon!!"

                "It’s impossible to pick a favorite memory, but one that stands out to me happened just a few years ago, when Sam, myself, and some of our other best friends got to witness the northern lights. I don’t remember exactly how we first noticed them, but once we did we were all awestruck. Most of us had never seen them before, and it was so much more incredible than I could have expected. We all went down to the dock and sat watching the lights dance around the sky. It was almost eerie how quickly the light seemed to move, and how it felt both very close to us and impossibly far away at the same time. Luckily Sam happens to have a talent for photography and she was able to take some beautiful pictures to capture the event. Seeing the lights for the first time alongside my best friends is an incredibly special memory I will never forget. It has been amazing to watch this place transform from a cozy little cabin to the stunning home that stands here today. I am so grateful to the Farley family for always welcoming me and giving me such beautiful memories, and I look forward to “Up North” adventures yet to come!"

                "One of my favorite cabin memories was getting foolishly caught in the rain while canoeing in the Boundary Waters at age 11 with my two best friends and one dramatically yelling ‘we can get there if we paddle fast enough!’ When all hope of survival seemed lost (we were only 100 yards away from our campsite and it was just rain). This is just one example of the countless memories that my friends and I all still laugh about and cherish to this day."

                "My second favorite part of Bebe’s Bungalow adventures is when Uncle Bud or Max Pauchnik would use this old fireplace in the backyard of Bebe’s Bungalow to filet fish caught while fishing on Lake Vermilion. Marty and Johnny learned to filet their own fish on this old fireplace converted to a filet fishing table. I also have fond memories of the bunkhouse (which was in the backyard) where Marty, Johnny, and Julie would sleep during in the many summers we visited from Texas."

A completely new activity but so many things on the up side: 1) setting up the spearing hut is pretty straightforward, 2) actually seeing fish swim by is exciting, 3) seeing big fish poke at the bait was intense, 4) spearing the dang pike was fun, and 5) I knew mom, Jerome, and the ghosts of Bebe and Max would appreciate one less pike in the lake!"

We had fun... until we were stopped by the DNR because our boat was "over the legal load of people." Cathy was ready with her answer - we had PFDs for everyone and there was NO list on the boat anywhere that said what the weight or person limit was on the boat! The DNR officer conceded the fact, warned Grandpa Bud that the tag was expired (he had the updated one in his truck!) and gave each of the kids coupons for ice cream cones because they had their lifejackets! Later, we went to Wolf Bay for dinner (though Aunt Lisa thought David was Steve and stuck her hand in his back pocket...oops!) then headed back to the cabin, mostly in the dark, taking on water with the full load of people! We made it back safely after 2+ hour ride back, but decided that we likely didn't need to do that again with a 25 horse motor."

Steve was the outdoorsman, not Dave or I. So Dave and a cabin didn't seem like a perfect match. I also had heard that they had 'fixed it up.' One presumes that they had made it more fun and livable for their kids to enjoy some hiking or fishing. So you can imagine my surprise when I finally made it to the "cabin" and found the home of my dreams sitting on the best part of the lake! I could see why everyone wanted to 'rough it' up at the cabin... and given Cathy's penchant for keeping the kitchen stocked to the brim with great food, it's the kind of place you don't really want to leave."

There, she taught me so much&mdash;how to cook (Bebe's pasta sauce recipe, potica), drive a manual, shoot/clean a gun, drive a boat, filet a fish, and, of course, make cocktails&mdash;and, less overtly, how to be a good host, neighbor, and friend, how to learn from our mistakes, be resilient, prioritize people over all things, choose your battles, revere our elders, and be open to new ideas. Above all, she taught me how to enjoy life and live each day like it is your last. For these and so many othe reasons, I am forever grateful to my mom and Bebe's cabin."

The boat ride that to this day I will never let Catherine forget! The best and probably most important memory of Bebe's Bungalow, however, is the fact that after years of not getting to know my cousin Catherine, I ended up meeting a wonderful friend, who  has a wonderful family. The Del Grecos are so much richer getting to know our cousins, the Farleys. I not only got to know my cousin, I ended up with something I never thought I would know... the comradery and love of a sister."

              <p>
                "From 1980 to 2005 there have been many summer trips to Trout Lake thru the Trout Lake Portage North of Lake Vermillion. They have all started with the 7 am reading of the list of supplies on the dock at Bebe’s cabin and three or 4 days later ended at the same dock after pizza at Nelson’s Moccasin Point Resort. Each summer we would take a side trip into one of the lakes adjacent to Trout which would usually begin around noon and end the same day back at the camp on Trout. The most frequent of these trips were to Oriniak to the North West and Little Trout to the North East. One of the more difficult of the trips was to Pine Lake, east of Trout and also Gowan which is just off the same creek to Pine. They were all good trips which tested our youngsters canoeing and portaging abilities mostly beyond their endurance and ability, but always memorable as a result. There was the Oriniak portage for its exhausting length and terrain but once there, it was a chance to catch the silver walleye which came in with every third or fourth fish we caught. There was the Pine Lake trip which had a short portage at the beginning but a usually hot and calm creek with one or two beaver dams on the winding span or a few miles. There were usually fish to be had in Pine but it was a long slow creek and to get there it usually tested our endurance with the paddles unlike Oriniak which tested our endurance with its portage."

                "Over the years I made these trips with my own children, an assortment of kids from Eau Claire and Brummeyer and his boys and the Pecarina children, Marty and Johnny; and finally with my grandchildren. This particular trip in the summer of 1993 was with Gary Brummeyer, Cory Brummeyer, Marty Pecarina, Johnny Pecarina, and Cory’s cousin Todd from Milwaukee. We had planned from the beginning to make a side trip which was longer than the day trips which we had been taking every summer from our campsite in Trout. On this trip we took smaller tents with us and packed for an overnight trip as far away as we could get from our campsite on Trout. Where that would be we were not entirely certain but it we thought we might make it to Buck lake and then attempt to come back by way of a creek from Buck to Pine lake and then back to Trout on the following day. We started around 10 am of our second day in Trout from our campsite just south of Little Trout at the bypass between Little Trout and the North Arm and proceeded to the short portage on the creek to Pine Lake. About one quarter of the way we have to cross over a beaver dam and about half way we make a sharp south turn toward Pine lake. Just before the turn South is a rock outcropping and a trail East at that point leads to Gowan and from Gowan another portage brought us to Buck Lake."

                "Buck is a lake that looks like a crack in the Earth. It is perhaps 75 yards wide and 250 yards long. It reminded me of the Richleau iron ore mine which the Hwy 53 now travels over as you enter Virginia from the South. We camped that evening on the South shore which was a ten foot rock wall with pines on top where we pitched our tents. We fished briefly before supper and caught a few snakey northerns and one walleye, not a hot fishing lake for all our troubles, but then, we did not have much time to find the fish before the sun was setting. In the morning we set out to find the creek that ran west to Pine Lake. Since it was a long skinny lake it was not hard to find on the west end. It turned out to be a waterless ravine full of brushy overgrowth which would have been impossible to navigate so we headed back the way we came. By afternoon we were back at Trout lake and our campsite there to find everything in tact so we were back to fishing Trout for the rest of the trip. An adventure which Marty and Johnny and their friends were to expand upon during the following year when they went beyond Buck to several other lakes and back through the North Arm of Trout. I did not make that trip but Marty or Johnny would certainly remember and relate their stories of that adventure the following year."
